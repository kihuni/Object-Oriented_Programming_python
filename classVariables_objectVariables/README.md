# Class And Object Variables

- When dealing with data we need to keep in mind the context in where their storage are defined.There are two types of fields(variables):
    - Class variables and object variables: they are classified depending on whether the class or the objects owns the variable.

# Class variables

- When we talk about class variables we mean that they can be accessed by all instances of that class.
    `N/A` When you make any changes on the variable, the change is seen by all the other instances
    
# Object Variables

- This is available or accessible only on the individual instance `i.e` its owned by each instance/object
